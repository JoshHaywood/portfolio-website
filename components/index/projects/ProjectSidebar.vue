On the back-end, I enhanced CRM integration, enabling staff to be assigned to prospects instantly, streamlining the transition from lead generation to active sales. I developed a data-scraping robot that utilised third-party APIs to expand the internal data pool over time, giving staff access to a growing range of prospects. Additionally, I introduced a campaign system where admins could upload CSV files of company data, automatically processing and presenting them as campaign-specific prospects.
