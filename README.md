# Portfolio Website

This project was a website that I created to use as a marketing tool to showcase my relevant experience and various projects that I have undertaken. 
The goal is to demonstrate my range of abilities to potential employers or people of interest, and to serve as a hub for my various social profiles on Github, LinkedIn, and email.
